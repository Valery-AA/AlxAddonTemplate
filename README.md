# Alx Addon Template
A Template for add-ons that implements automation for the development process

## Automation
- Module Auto-Loader <br>
The module auto-loader allows for multi-file add-ons to skip entirely the process of closing and opening blender to see changes reflected.
Automates the register and unregister process, meaning all the developer has to do is press `F3 > reload scripts` and all new files, classes and changes will be directly available in blender without any additional effort past the class creation itself
